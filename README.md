# CSB Map Viewer
## Visualize public CSB data on a map

The OG bathy viewer is available here and managed by NOAA: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/bathymetry/

This project is a simple web app intended for individuals contributing to the
CSB database to be able to visualize their own data on the map. That is
currently possible in the NOAA viewer also of course, but this project will make
it easier and allow the user to save their platform to their account so they can
always view it.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
and then run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You will need the variables defined in the .env.template file in an actual .env
file in the root of the project.
